# KubeVerse: Scalable Node.js Microservices Orchestra

KubeVerse is a comprehensive solution for building scalable microservices using Node.js, integrated with an event bus system, and designed to run on Kubernetes. This project incorporates Docker for containerization, Next.js for frontend services, and a robust set of tools for managing distributed systems.

## Features

- **Microservices Architecture**: Utilizes Node.js to create modular, independent services that communicate through an event bus system.
- **Event Bus System**: Implements an efficient communication layer using an event-driven architecture for seamless interaction between microservices.
- **Kubernetes Orchestration**: Designed to be deployed and managed on Kubernetes for scalability, fault tolerance, and ease of management.

- **Dockerized Services**: Each microservice is encapsulated within a Docker container for consistency and portability across environments.

- **Next.js Integration**: Includes Next.js for frontend services, providing server-side rendering and efficient React-based UIs.
